#### *Jiro: Dutch, Amsterdam based, experimental conceptual nerdy fine artist.*

I'm a continuously learning web nerd, experimental artist, cartoonist, homo universalis and genderqueer spokesperson based in Amsterdam (Netherlands).
I started HTML in 1998 when it was still cute and I'm now moving into deeper concepts, such as SASS and mySQL. My big dream is to make technology diversity-friendly for minorities.
I am always on a quest for new shapes, new apps, new interactivities and new programming languages. Why..? Because I love it! [JirosWorld company](http://www.jirosworld.com).

Jiro is available for projects on a case by case basis. Some of the services he provides include:
